# The Ad-Grab tool was created to aid information gathering for System Administrators, Pen Testers, or just curios
# individuals wanting to obtain Active Directory information within their forest/domain. 

# This tool provides many options that allow the user to query AD and return very detailed or very large sets of data.
# Options allow for querying Groups, Organizational Units, Users, Computers, Domain Controllers, etc.

# Once comfortable with the tool and AD connections, many options can be blended together to drill down large sets 
# of AD contiainers/objects in to more detailed object listings.

# This tool only utilized pre-installed/authorized PowerShell cmd-lets to query the AD, so don't be afraid to
# get curious and blast away! 

# Installation: Download or copy/paste to a '.ps1' file and run from the command line.

# This tool does not include many fancy features outside bsic quesrying so lease feel free so give
# advice, ideas, and opinions on how it can be improved!

# Thanks.
